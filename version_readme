This is the state of the tree just after the submission.

PARTY has the modifications:

  - accepts previous models: with `--previous <smt2 model file>`
    (needs format: nof_states\n then function models with _old postfix)
  - direct encoding of gr1 semantics on smt level (parses ltl file and identifies what can be encoded)
  - probably nothing else, `p_bosy` with `--opt sync_hub --weakag` should work.
